# AngularHighchartsPhrase

Reproduce compatibility issue between highcharts and phrase ICE in angular / ngx-translate app

The app should show a chart with a translated title, it will also inject Phrase's in-context editor.
The translation 'bubble' will briefly appear on the chart title and then disappear.

The Phrase project Id is hardcoded in file 'load-in-context-editor.ts', replace it there whenever required. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
